# Enhanced Controller (Experimental Module)

This module introduces a structured, modular extension to the Clone Robotics `clone_client` project, focused on improving control, feedback, and safety mechanisms in human-robot interaction.

## Purpose

To develop a more flexible and intelligent control layer for the Clone Hand that integrates:

- Sensor-aware motion planning
- Real-time motion annotation
- Safety and collision-detection primitives
- Human-in-the-loop feedback buttons
- Modular subsystem architecture for clarity and extensibility

## Status

This is an early-stage integration for feedback-enabled control of the Clone Hand and is not yet production-grade. Use only for experimental development and hardware-safe simulation.

## Author

This is a public open-source enhancement contributed independently under permissive reuse.
